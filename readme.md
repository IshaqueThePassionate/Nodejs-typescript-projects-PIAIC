# JavaScript Command-Line Projects

## Overview

This repository contains five command-line projects implemented using JavaScript and Node.js. Each project demonstrates different aspects of interactive command-line applications, leveraging the `inquirer` module for user input and `chalk` for enhanced console output. Below is a brief overview of each project.

## Projects

1. **Ishaque Calculator**
    - A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users input two numbers and select an operation to see the result.

2. **ATM Machine Simulator**
    - An ATM machine simulation where users can check their balance and withdraw money. It includes a pin verification step to ensure secure access.

3. **Number Guessing Game**
    - A fun game where users have three attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 10. The game provides feedback on the guessed numbers and announces the correct number if the user fails to guess it.

4. **To-Do List Application**
    - A straightforward to-do list manager that allows users to add tasks interactively. The application continues to prompt for new tasks until the user decides to stop.

5. **Currency Converter**
    - A currency converter that enables users to convert amounts between different currencies based on predefined conversion rates. The application supports multiple currencies and provides a continuous loop for multiple conversions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- Each project may require additional npm packages (`inquirer`, `chalk`). You can install them using:
  ```bash
  npm install inquirer chalk
  ```

### Running the Projects

1. **Ishaque Calculator**
    - Save the script to a file, e.g., `calculator.js`, and run it:
      ```bash
      node calculator.js
      ```

2. **ATM Machine Simulator**
    - Save the script to a file, e.g., `atmMachine.js`, and run it:
      ```bash
      node atmMachine.js
      ```

3. **Number Guessing Game**
    - Save the script to a file, e.g., `guessNumber.js`, and run it:
      ```bash
      node guessNumber.js
      ```

4. **To-Do List Application**
    - Save the script to a file, e.g., `todo.js`, and run it:
      ```bash
      node todo.js
      ```

5. **Currency Converter**
    - Save the script to a file, e.g., `currencyConverter.js`, and run it:
      ```bash
      node currencyConverter.js
      ```
